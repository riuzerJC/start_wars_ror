# README

Your assignment will be to create an API application on RoR.

We will provide the seed of the following  Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
* Create_Star_Wars.sql
* Populate_Star_Wars.sql
* The API application should have:
* Basic authentication:
* User and password authentication.
* Password recovery.
* Passwords should be stored using encryption or hashing.
* All resources should have CRUD capabilities.
* Model relationships should be well defined.
* Database should be the default SQLite.
* Database should be populated with the seed file.
* Config files should be well set up.
* Application port should be 8000.

The Repo should have a README file where it explains how to run the project and what is needed to do so. We encourage the use of gems when available.
